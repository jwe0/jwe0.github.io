            <p># TryHackMe Advent of Cyber</p>
            <p>Every year since 2019 the cyber security platform TryHackMe (THM) has hosted an advent of cyber during the Christmas season that allows pen testers to complete challenges every day of advent. I decided this year to participate and this will be a blog post I will update each day with a new walk-through of the rooms.</p>
            <h2>Day 1.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Us as penetration testers have discovered a YouTube to MP3 website that has been reported as malicious, we decide to check it out since these types of websites are used for malware campaigns to distribute malware or perform mass phishing attacks.</p>
            <h4>The attack</h4>
            <p>We visit the website to be met with a box asking for a YouTube link to download the MP3, I supply a random video and get a zip file called "download.zip". This zip file contains 2 files "song.mp3" and "somg.mp3" a misspelt version of "song.mp3" designed to trick the user into running it instead of the "song.mp3".</p>
            <p>I check the file types of each file to discover that "song.mp3" is an audio file BUT "somg.mp3" is an MS shortcut that executes powershell code.</p>
            <p>I run "cat somg.mp3" to check the content and get a github link "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1". This leads to a simple stealer written in powershell.</p>
            <p>I discover the C2 server located @ "http://papash3ll.thm/data".</p>
            <p>From here I discovered a tag from the hacker "Created by the one and only M.M.", I search this on GitHub and discover a GitHub issue "https://github.com/Bloatware-WarevilleTHM/CryptoWallet-Search/issues/1" which someone called "MM-WarevilleTHM" opens.</p>
            <p>I am pretty sure this is the mysterious M.M, I check their config file to find their name is "Mayor Malware".</p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>1. I discover the author using Exiftool</p>
            <p>2. I find the C2 server in the malware payload I discovered in the "somg.mp3"</p>
            <p>3. I find M.Ms name using their GitHub config file</p>
            <p>4. I find the issues using GitHub</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>This was a fun little room teaching penetration testers how important OPSEC is and how 1 small slip up can unravel your entire operation.</p>
            <h2>Day 2.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>We as the SOC have been alerted of activity on our network and it is our job to find the cause of the issue and what has caused it.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>First we navigate to the elastic portal given to us by THM and go to the discover tab</p>
            <img src="/Assets/Images/Pasted image 20241202201803.png">
            <p>We are informed that the activity occurred on Dec 1st, 2024, between 0900 and 0930 so we set our time window to this and get 21 hits. The data at the moment is not very easy to read and we need to format it.</p>
            <p>We apply filters to get the date, host, username, event type, command and the event outcome which allows us to see that an attacker has executed a powershell script on our system which immediately raises red flags for me.</p>
            <p>We filter for authentication attempts and roll back to the 29th to be presented with a lot of access attempts that shows us an attempted brute force attack, we filter out our IP and are left with an attacker that successfully authenticated with a brute force attack.</p>
            <p>However it seems this person gained access to the ADM-01 account with weak credentials that they then changed and forced an update for by using the powershell script that reboots the system.</p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>1. The account with attempted login attempts is the account with the most access attempts</p>
            <p>2. We filter to find the amount</p>
            <p>3. We filter to find the IP</p>
            <p>4. We filter to find the date</p>
            <p>5. We decode the string in the powershell script</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Overall this was a fun room that gives a basic insight into what SOC staff deal with and can allow people to dip their toes into this subject without fully committing yet.</p>
            <h2>Day 3.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>We as penetration testers are given a Blue and red team task, we are told to investigate what has happened and discover the source and learn how RCE exploits can happen due to unsanitized file uploads.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <h4>Operation Blue</h4>
            <p>Similarly to yesterday we are using Elastic to check logs and today we are searching through Apache2 logs. We change our collection of logs to "wareville-rails", it shows us no results but that is because by default we are searching from the last 15 minutes. We change the time frame, starting at "**October 1 2024 00:00:00**" and going to "**October 1 23:59:59**".</p>
            <p>We discover someone has sent requests and a file called "shell.php" has been accessed, this seems to be a web shell of some kind uploaded via an insecure file upload</p>
            <p>We filter by the "shell.php" and get 11 hits.</p>
            <h3>Operation Red</h3>
            <p>In this section we are learning how web shells work, how file uploads can be exploited and how we can do so ourselves.</p>
            <p>We navigate to "frostypines.thm" and are met with a website, we see a login tab and click on it. We do not have the credentials but we can guess using default credentials like "admin", after gaining access we find an admin panel at "/admin". We can create a new room which I do and for the image I upload a simple PHP RCE file. We go back to the normal website. navigate to the rooms, open the image in a new tab and voila we have a command bar we can use to run commands.</p>
            <p>We run "ls" to find that the flag.txt is in the cwd so I "cat flag.txt" to get the flag file.</p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>1. We find this in the logs when filtering for "shell.php" in the message</p>
            <p>2. We find this in the logs when we filter for IPs</p>
            <p>3. We find this after successfully uploading an RCE file and gaining a web shell</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Overall I really enjoyed this room, it included some aspects from yesterdays room and it also taught us what web shells are and how they work.</p>
            <h2>Day 4.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Glitch has been revamping the towns security defenses by adding a firewall, patching vulnerabilities and discovering exploits that he then patched. Unaware of Glitchs good intent the SOC team launched an investigation into Glitch.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>We will be identifying malicious attacks using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we will learn how to use the Atomic Red Team tests to conduct a simulated attack.</p>
            <p>First we use the ART to setup an phishing attack that goes by "T1566.001", we then have to detect it in the log. We find the event and navigate to it's path to which we find a file called "PhishingAttachment.txt" which contains a flag.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. We find this in the path from the logs</p>
            <p>2. Found on google</p>
            <p>3. Found on google</p>
            <p>4. Run "-ShowDetails" on T1059.003</p>
            <p>5. Go to the path of the malware file found in the execution logs</p>
            <p>6. Found in that file</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Overall this room was a lot more difficult than other rooms, it posed a greater challenge but was also one of my favorite rooms because of my sense of accomplishment.</p>
            <h2>Day 5.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Software was finishing up some software and on his way home he sees a young boy looking sad, he asks "What would you like for Christmas?" the boy responded "I wish for a teddy bear, but I know that my family can't afford one.". This sparked an idea in Software's head, what if he made an app where everyone could share ideas and the mayor could help make them come true.</p>
            <p>Them mayor immediately endorsed this idea, even chipping in to help but through the haste they left bugs in the software that we are going to find.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>Today we are looking at XML and XXS vulnerabilities where entities can be exploited to pull down sensitives files that the parser will show.</p>
            <p>When we navigate to the web page we are met with the wish list, we add an item to our cart and view our cart by proceeding to payment, we intercept the product.php request to find XML data being transmitted, we edit the payload to get the "/etc/hosts" file and we see that we can access that file with this showing that we can use an XXS exploit.</p>
            <p>We craft a payload to get the wishes file we couldn't access earlier.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. We find this by bruteforcing the wishlist path</p>
            <p>2. We find this in the CHANGELOG path</p>
            <h2>Day 6.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Today we are doing malware analysis using sandbox tools, exploring how to use YARA rules to detect malicious patterns on a system, learn about malware evasion techniques and implementing our own evasion technique.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>Today we learn how the registry can be used to detect sandbox environments and how to use floss to analyse strings from a malware exeutable.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. Found after using the .\JingleBells.ps1</p>
            <p>2. Found after using floss.exe to analyse the malware</p>
            <h2>Day 7.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Today we are analyzing AWS logs. A company called care4wares has had their donations stolen and it is our job to analyse the logs and find the source.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>We are tasked with analyzing the cloudtrail log file and finding who or what is responsible for the lack of donations. We use jq to summarize the information into an easier to read format.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>All answers are found from directly analyzing the log file with custom jq options.</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Overall this was a challenging room, I got stuck a lot during this but it taught me a lot about AWS logs and JQ.</p>
            <h2>Day 8.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Today we are working with shellcode, reversee shells and fundamentals.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>We are using msfvenom to generate a windows reverse shell using tcp, this will be ran on the victims machine to allow an attacker a tunnel into the victims network.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. Sadly today I was unable to complete this task due to Windows defender flagging and removing the reverse shell, the attackbox and target being slow and overall being buggy.</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Overall this room could've been fun but it was slow and buggy.</p>
            <h2>Day 9.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Today we are going over GRC ( Governance, Risk and Compliance).</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>We will be performing a risk assessment on given statements.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. Found by completing the assesment</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>This was a very small room that just briefly went over GRC, just enough to understand.</p>
            <h2>Day 10.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>In today's attack we are talking about phishing and file macros, understanding what both of them are and how macros can lead to attacks.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>First we use Metasploit msfconsole to generate a malicious word macro file that will allow us a tcp reverse shell onto a windows system.</p>
            <p>We log into the mail portal and compose an email to `marta@socmas.thm`, we attach the payload as a file and rename it to something more convincing like "receipt.docm" or "invoice.docm".</p>
            <p>We listen using msfconsole `multi/handler` on the port we specified for the exploit, from the point we send the email we must wait for the target to execute the payload on their system.</p>
            <img src="/Assets/Images/Pasted image 20241211154620.png">
            <p>Yes! From this point we navigate to the administrators desktop and retrieve the flag.</p>
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Overall I loved this room, i'm a big fan of offensive security especially exploitation and enumeration. This room outlines the basics of meterpreter and how to create exploits</p>
            <h2>Day 11.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Today we are learning about exploits in wireless technologies.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>First we connect to the ssh server given to us, we find the wireless points available to us using the iw dev command</p>
            <img src="/Assets/Images/Pasted image 20241212170542.png">
            <p>We then scan for nearby devices.</p>
            <img src="/Assets/Images/Pasted image 20241212170622.png">
            <p>We change wlan2 to monitor mode and use airodump-ng to monitor the network. We send deauth packets to the network to force the client to have to reconnect to the network allowing us to get a handshake.</p>
            <p>We use airocrack-ng to bruteforce the password.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. Found using iw dev</p>
            <p>2. Same as Q1</p>
            <p>3. Same as Q2</p>
            <p>4. Same as Q3</p>
            <h2>Day 12.</h2>
            <h3>Outline</h3>
            <p>Today we have been called because a bank has had fraudulent transactions placed. We are exploring race conditions and timing attacks.</p>
            <h3>The attack</h3>
            <p>We use burpsuite or a script to quickly send multiple requests at the same time in parallel, a well made system should handle one at a time but this system is buggy leading each transaction to go through.</p>
            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <p>1. Found by successfully transferring 2000 to an account</p>
