            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>I have recently begun exploring TryHackMe in November to enhance my skills in Cyber Sec. I have enjoyed Boot 2 Root rooms mostly since I loved finding vulnerabilities in software to escalate my privileges, I discovered it was fairly satisfying.</p>
            <p>For the following statistics keep in mind I've been doing this for less than a month!</p>
            <h1>Stats</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I was in the top 98% of the United Kingdom</li>
                <li>I have spent 33 days learning</li>
                <li>I have a 23 day streak</li>
                <li>I earned 5 badges this year</li>
                <li>I have completed 31 badges this year (almost one every day)</li>
                <li>I have answered 393 questions in total</li>
                <li>Security Analysis is my topic of the year but I have also shown focus in Security Operations and Penetration Testing.</li>
