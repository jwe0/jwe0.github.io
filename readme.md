# Jwe0 Blog

Hello and welcome, you have stumbled upon my repository for my Blog site, feel free to look around and modify code as you see fit I am open to pull requests and suggestions.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to make this after finding out about Hugo that turns your markdown into html, I thought it was cool that I could write a note in obsidian then run a script that makes that into a good looking webpage so my brain started moving and I made this.

Hugo allows for custom styling and offers a vast range of free premium themes that look good, work well and overall feel really modern and professional, however I am not the sort of person that enjoys using prebuilt software so I had to make this.
